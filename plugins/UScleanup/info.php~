	 attempt to use the format "(xxx) xxx-xxxx".  If a default area code is
	 specified by the administrator, then it will add that area code to any 
	 phone numbers that lack an area code.  For the address, it will attempt
	 to verify the address against the US Postal Service address database.  
	 This requires a user ID for the USPS address verification system.  See
	 http://www.usps.com/webtools/address.htm and read carefully the 
	 procedures for registration and use of the USPS API.  If the address
	 check fails, the address will remain unchanged.  If it succeeds, the 
	 address will be returned in all caps with the correct zip code included.
	 The code expects to find the variables in $_SESSION and updates the values
	 in place.');
