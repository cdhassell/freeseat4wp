This file lists all hooks currently supported by freeseat.

The (concat) tag indicates the plugin should return a string, and
outputs of all plugins will be concatenated.

The (exists) tag indicates that the plugin should return a Boolean
indicating whether it provided a certain functionality, or whether an
error occurred (the meaning of the output value varies from hook to
hook, see below). The calling code then gets to know if at least one
plugin returned true and acts accordingly.

The (sum) tag indicates that the plugin should return an integer, and 
the outputs of all plugins will be summed and returned by the hook function.

Some hooks are followed by a variable name indicating they must take
one parameter. The parameter is called $void when it is not used
(i.e. is always null, but implementing functions must declare it
anyway).

*** adminprint_line
Called near the end of adminprint's output to add output on the same line.

*** adminprint_process
Called near the end of adminprint's output to add output on the same line.

*** book_hook ($bookid)
Called near the end of the book() function in functions/booking.php. 
$bookid is passed from the book function.

*** bookinglist_pagebottom
called near the bottom of the bookinglist

*** bookinglist_process
Called when the bookinglist receives a POST query (may not output anything!)

*** (concat) booking_return ($booking)
Allow plugins pdftickets and barcode to cooperate. Called by pdftickets to
get output from barcode which dompdf code can handle. $booking is the first
ticket purchased.

*** (concat) bookinglist_tableheader ($void)
Permits adding <th> headers to the bookinglist table. Must have a
corresponding  bookinglist_tablerow with as many <td>s.

*** (concat) bookinglist_tablerow ($b)
Called for each row in the booking list table. $b: the booking entry
to display.

*** ccard_checkamount ($transid)
Must return (from the external credit card processor) the amount
corresponding to the given transaction id.

*** ccard_confirm_button
Displays a "confirm" button on the confirm.php page if the user is
about to request a credit card payment.

*** (exists) ccard_exists ($void)
Must return true if credit card payment is supported.

*** (exists) ccard_ipn_auth ($void)
Must return true if the HTTP client is authorised to notify credit
card payments.

*** ccard_partner
Called in pay.php when credit card payment is possible. May be used to
display the credit card partner logo or link to their website.

*** ccard_paymentform
Called in finish.php to create the <form> containing payment
information (typically as hidden fields), that must then be submitted
to the credit card partner.

*** (exists) ccard_readparams ($void)
Called in ccard_confirm.php to retrieve transaction information
(typically from _GET or _POST fields) and record it into the global
variables $groupid, $transid and $unsafeamount. the Return true if
parameters could be retrieved successfully.

*** config_db
Produce (html-escaped) mysql code to setup database tables and grants
required by your plugin (Do not run the mysql statements, just echo
them to the client), in such a way that, after the printed code is
executed, your config_missingdb will return false.
- When this hook is called we are already connected to the database.
- You may assume that when your *mysql* code is run, the base tables
  (given in FS_PATH/tables.sql) are available, so for instance you can
  use ALTER TABLE to add columns.
- However you may NOT assume the base tables are available at the time
  your *php* code is run. Moreover, if your config_missingdb returns
  false this may still be called, and must not print anything.
- It is recommended you use the config_include_sql function for this
  hook.

*** config_form ($form)
When $form is true, must generate a form letting the user configure
your plugin. When $form is false, must process the corresponding POST
parameters and produce the corresponding (html-escaped) php code for
inclusion in config.php. Most plugins implementing this will just call
the config_form *function* in plugins/config/functions.php, with the
right config-dist parameter.

*** (exists) config_missingdb ($void)
Called by the config plugin when deciding if the database is correctly
set up. Return true if the database we're connected to doesn't contain
tables or columns or grants required by your plugin. Do not attempt to
fix the problem, that's the job of config_db)

*** confirm_bottom
Called near the bottom of the confirm.php page

*** confirm_process
Called when receiving data from confirm.php (i.e. this hook is
actually called in finish.php). Must not output anything.

*** front_page_admin
Called in the admin section of the main page when the admin is logged
in.

*** front_page_public
Called in the main index.php page below the spectacle booking lists.

*** front_page_showlist ($spectacle)
Called to display information about available spectacles on the front page.

*** (concat) get_print ($data)
Called to add extra information to the end of print_booked_seats() in 
functions/format.php.  $data parameter is an array of seats booked by 
the user.

*** (sum) get_total ($data)
Called to add or subtract from the total price charged to the user for
his tickets.  Any numbers returned by plugins on this hook are totaled and
subtracted from the total price.  $data parameter is an array of seats booked
by the user.

*** (exists) pay_page_top
Called at the top of pay.php.  If the result is true, kill_booking_done()
is not called.  If no plugins use this hook, the normal process occurs.  
Used to preserve booking data when entering the payment process.

*** seatmap_top
Called above the seatmaps in seats.php

*** ticket_finalise
Called after tickets have been printed. Plugins rendering tickets with
ticket_render should display the content of the $legal_info variable
when this hook is called.

*** (exists) ticket_left($booking)
Called by the htmltickets plugin on the left of each ticket where the
booking id is normally displayed. Plugins providing a replacement for
standard booking id display should return true.

*** ticket_prepare
Called once when the program is about to display a series of tickets
with ticket_render. A corresponding ticket_finalise is called when all
ticket_render have been called.

*** ticket_render ($booking)
Called when a ticket should be provided to the user.

*** ticket_finalise_override
Called after tickets have been printed. Ticketing-printing plugins may 
request to override ticket rendering from other plugins by implementing 
the _override hooks, and returning true in ticket_prepare_override. Most 
ticket printing routines should only implement the non-override hooks. Of 
course if more than one plugin requests overriding ticket rendering, all 
such plugins will be run side by side.

*** ticket_prepare_override
Called once when the program is about to display a series of tickets
with ticket_render. Ticketing-printing plugins may request to override 
ticket rendering from other plugins by implementing the _override hooks, 
and returning true in ticket_prepare_override. Most ticket printing 
routines should only implement the non-override hooks. Of course if more 
than one plugin requests overriding ticket rendering, all such plugins 
will be run side by side.

*** ticket_render_override ($booking)
Called when a ticket should be provided to the user.  Ticketing-printing 
plugins may request to override ticket rendering from other plugins by 
implementing the _override hooks, and returning true in 
ticket_prepare_override. Most ticket printing routines should only implement 
the non-override hooks. Of course if more than one plugin requests overriding 
ticket rendering, all such plugins will be run side by side.
