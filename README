Quick legalese before we start :

Copyright (c) 2010 Maxime Gamboni. Modification and Redistribution is
permitted under the terms of the GNU GPL version 2 (see "COPYING") or,
at your option, any later version of the said license, provided this
notice and the COPYING files are left unchanged.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

General Public License for more details.

Trade marks mentionned in this file and elsewhere are owned by their
respective owners. (That seems tautological to me but
legalese-speaking people like saying that so I'll just follow)

If you use this program it would be nice if you sent me an email I
would be happy to hear what you think of it and what you it for ...
You can contact me at tendays at users point sourceforge point net.

Also, if you are running a (non-trivially) modified version, please
include on the publicly accessible side of the application a link
providing access to the modified source code. (E.g. next to (or
replacing) the "Powered by" link printed by show_foot(), in
format.php).

Or even better, send your changes to me (e.g. as a support request on
the sf.net website) so that I may consider including them in the main
distribution.

Read the INSTALL file for installation instructions. Merely unpacking the archive under a webserver document root is NOT ENOUGH.
